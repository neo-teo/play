My partners were Myles and Sushmita.

I took Myle's dodo bird body and Sushmita's rabbit carcas head. (I had a pirate).

Dodo backstory -- 
This is Donald. Donald is moving from the island of Mauritius. 
His eggs were eaten by imported Dutch pigs. The water supply is tainted with waste. 
The island’s simply not what it used to be. Donald looks wistfully into the distance 
as he decides whether he should set all of the Dutch ships aflame. Donald has no other 
way off of the island. Now, he could set fire to all but one of the ships. But that’s 
not how Donald does things. Donald is thorough. If one goes down they all do. The day 
of reckoning is nigh.

Rabbit carcas backstory -- 

Remember, my love, the object we saw
That beautiful morning in June:
By a bend in the path a carcass reclined
On a bed sown with pebbles and stones;

Her legs were spread out like a lecherous whore,
Sweating out poisonous fumes,
Who opened in slick invitational style
Her stinking and festering womb


I started by making my character on figma with as many circles / rounded rectangles as possible,
to make it p5.js shape compatible.

The character's new backstory is on the sketch.

This was incredibly fun. I am happy with how reusable the code is. I think I'm getting better at
organizing things in order to allow me to animate. I'm especially happy with how the earring played 
out.
