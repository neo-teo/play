Tough week 4 me -- no internet for 2 days, lost my phone. Was only able to work on this for a bit late last night.

I decided the goal was to make an illusion that is "revealed" when the user clicks the mouse. 

I tried to do the "what color are the squares in the middle" illusion. 
Clicking the mouse expands the center color until it covers the whole screen, revealing they were indeed the same.
Clicking again resets to a new color palette.

At its best (if I changed the illusion / reveal) to something more interesting, ideally it would be a fun site to 
share with friends.
