This is the home for Teo's interactive js explorations.

## Developing

I would love if you are so inclined to play around with the parameters in these and make something new out of them. Here are steps below for how to do that:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neo-teo/play.git
cd play
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should now see the app running at localhost:5173 and individual sketches at localhost:5173/<sketchname> where <sketchname> comes from the sketch folder name (e.g. localhost:5173/face)
